# Alabama-Unmanned-Systems-Operations-Mastery-for-Educators
#The Alabama Unmanned Systems Operations Mastery for Educators (AUSOME) is a STEM
#education program managed out of the UAH Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research Program.
#For the past two years, AUSOME has been providing instruction and hands-on training for
#educators across the country on how to incorporate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or drones,
#into the classroom. UAS offer a unique perspective as a learning platform for anything and
#everything falling under Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education but are
#also excellent tools for creative learning and problem solving. The U.S. Space and Rocket
#Center, home of Space Camp and Aviation Challenge, have adopted AUSOME as a key element
#to the Space Camp for Educators summer programs as well as the State Teachers of the Year
#professional development program

#The purpose of this Github is to have an easy to access location for the lesson plans and corosponding code.
